# Bamboo CLI

CLI tool for automating the generation of daily work hour entries

## Features
- Automatically generates work hour entries for each workday between a given start and end date.
- Configurable daily work hours with three time slots: morning, break, and afternoon.
- Randomized work hours to simulate realistic entries.
- Excludes weekends, public holidays, and specified PTO days.
- Populates missing work entries on BambooHR

## Prerequisites

Download and install:

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.23+ recommended)


## Configuration

### Config File
The application uses a configuration file, `config.json`, which stores default values for your Bamboo `apiToken` and `employeeId`
```json
{
    "apiToken": "yourBambooApiToken",
    "employeeId": 123
}
```

## Building the app

```bash
$ go build -o bamboo main.go
```

## Running the app

### `list` command (skip config params if they're stored in `config.json`)
```bash
$ ./bamboo --apiKey yourBambooApiToken --employeeId 123  --start 2024-09-01 --end 2024-10-01 list
```

### `add` command (skip config params if they're stored in `config.json`)
```bash
$ ./bamboo --apiKey yourBambooApiToken --employeeId 123  --start 2024-09-01 --end 2024-10-01 --excludeDays 2024-09-15,2024-09-20 add
```

## Options
- `--apiKey` (**Required**) API token for BambooHR authentication
- `--employeeId`: (**Required**) Employee ID for whom the entries are generated - found in your BambooHR's URL
- `--start`: (**Required**) Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `--end`: (**Required**) End date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- `--excludeDays`: (__Optional__) Comma-separated list of PTO dates in YYYY-MM-DD format. These dates will be excluded from work hour entries

## Example
### Generate work entries for October 2024, excluding October 28th, 29th and October 30th for PTO, October 31st is public holiday

(skip config params if they're stored in `config.json`)
```bash
$ ./bamboo --apiKey yourBambooApiToken --employeeId 123 --start 2024-10-01 --end 2024-11-01 --excludeDays 2024-10-28,2024-10-29,2024-10-30
```
